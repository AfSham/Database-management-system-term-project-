# Issues
- Hybrid system: each issue is either atomic or a ticket stub
    - Ticket stubs act as parents for smaller more granular subtickets (atomic)
    - Ticket stubs are marked by the "stub" label
    - All other tickets should be atomic -- sufficiently small so as to be indivisible with respect to a reasonable workflow
- It is better to have tickets that are too small than too large
- All productivity should have a ticket which reflects it -- including direct/indirect work on the paper such as a literature review
- Every ticket should be assigned to at least one person
- Discussion should happen freely on tickets

# Dev workflow
- To check for  compliance: Checkstyle
- Code should conform to Javadoc standards
- To run unit-tests: JUnit5
